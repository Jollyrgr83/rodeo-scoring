# Annual Lineworkers Rodeo Scoring App

This project was designed to handle the scoring, ranking, and reporting for a regional competition testing Lineworker skills. The competition consists of multiple competition tiers. Each tier could consist of individuals or teams and each tier is tested on different events. All events are scored and timed. A final report ranks competitors by score with ties broken by the faster event time. Reports can be filtered by tier, event, and organization.
